## 🏃‍♂️ Usage

1. **Running Tests**:Running Tests: using the runner file located on src/test/java/backend/testParallel.java command will run
   all the features exposed in the project and generate the proper reports

## Reporting

1. **Cucumber Reporting**:after running the tests using the runner previously discussed a test report made with cucumber will be
   generated in the **target/cucumber-html-reports** route, and results can be further viewed in the newly generated cucumber overviews,
   An example of the results is shown below:
